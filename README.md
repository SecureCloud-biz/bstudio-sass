# Bootstrap Studio SASS sidekick

`bstudio-sass` is a helper utility for compiling SASS in Bootstrap Studio. To use it, install it on your local machine and configure Bootstrap Studio to know where to find it. It runs on Windows, MacOS and Linux.

## Installation

To install `bstudio-sass`, make sure that you  have node.js 8.0 or later, and follow the steps outlined in [our tutorial](https://bootstrapstudio.io/tutorials/writing-sass).

## Troubleshooting

If you run `bstudio-sass` and see a *command not found* error, this would mean that the utility is not installed correctly. Make sure that it is installed globally with the `-g` flag. If it still doesn't work, maybe node is not installed correctly or your system needs a restart.
